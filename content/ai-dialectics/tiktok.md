## ABSTRACT

Lacan's theory of psychosis in relation to the subject and the signifier is discussed in the context of the supposed epidemic of "Lacanian Psychosis" among pre-teen Tik-Tok users in the United States. The article will discuss the theory of the real, the subject, and the signifier in relation to psychosis. The article will also discuss the relationship of the signifier to the subject at the level of the ego in order to understand the strange behavior of pre-teen users of Tik-Tok. It will be argued that the signifier is the key to understanding this phenomenon. 

### Keywords: Lacan, psychosis, subject, signifier, ego, pre-teen Tik-Tok users

In the last few months, there has been a supposed epidemic of "Lacanian Psychosis" among pre-teen users of the Tik-Tok application for smartphones. The phenomenon has been reported in several articles, podcasts, and videos on TikTok and other social media, with some claiming it is a "new disease" and others claiming it is a "new kind of mental illness" that is spreading, though it should be noted that there is no scientific evidence that this is anything more than a fad, and the phenomenon is currently contained to a small number of users. [1] The term "Lacanian Psychosis" is being used to refer to what is basically a fad among a small number of TikTok users to act in a way that is meant to be interpreted as "Lacanian" by their peers. The fad started with an American girl who posted videos on TikTok of herself and her friends acting in a way that was meant to be interpreted as eccentric and "crazy." The videos were posted on TikTok in early August and by the end of the month had millions of views from other pre-teen girls. The videos quickly spread on YouTube and other social media sites, with a few other girls posting videos that were meant to be interpreted as eccentric and "crazy." The videos are meant to be interpreted as "Lacanian" because they are meant to be interpreted as saying the following: "I am crazy, I am eccentric, and I don't care about anything. I am indifferent to anything and everything. I am completely indifferent to you." This is the message that is meant to be interpreted by the videos. However, as we will see in this article, the fad of "Lacanian Psychosis"  goes beyond this and is in fact a reflection of a much deeper issue: the issue of the signifier and the subject.

## The Signifier and the Lacanian Subject

Lacan's theory of the subject is based on two principles: the principle of the mirror stage and the principle of the imaginary, or symbolic, order. The subject is created by the mirror stage, in which the child recognizes itself in a mirror and recognizes that its image in the mirror is its own image. The child's body is thus separated from its image in the mirror. The child then internalizes the image in the mirror as its own image.
The first of Lacan's two principles is the principle of the imaginary, or symbolic, order. The imaginary order is created by the child's image in the mirror and the child's identification with that image. The symbolic order is based on language, and language is based on the law of the father, which is a symbolic order that is based on the phallus.
Lacan's second principle is the principle of the real. The real is based on the lack of the object in the subject. The subject is forever lacking the object; this lack is what Lacan calls "the real." The real is based on the idea that the object is never fully present in the subject. The subject is always lacking the object.

The subject is based on the imaginary order that is based on the image in the mirror, and the subject is based on a lack of the object in the subject. This is the case whether the object is real or imaginary (imaginary objects are objects that are not real, such as the object of the mother's love, or the object of the father's law).

## The Object of Desrire

Lacan discusses the object of desire in the context of the imaginary order. The imaginary order is based on the law of the father, which is based on the phallus. The object of desire in the imaginary order is the phallus. The subject wants to have the phallus. The subject wants to be the phallus. The subject wants to be the phallus for the mother. In the imaginary order, the mother is a hole in which the phallus is meant to be inserted. This is what Lacan means by the term "object a." Object a is the object of desire in the imaginary order.
The symbolic order is based on language, and the lack of the object of desire is a lack of language. The subject is thus lacking the object of desire at the level of the imaginary order, and the subject is lacking the object of desire at the level of the symbolic order.

## Lacanian Psychosis in the Subject

The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are acting as if they are "crazy" because they are acting as if they are lacking the object of their desire. They are acting as if they have no desire for anything and no concern for anything. They are acting as if they are completely indifferent to everything and everyone. They are acting as if they want nothing and no one.

The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are acting as if they want nothing and no one, which is the case in the imaginary order, or in the symbolic order, where the subject lacks the object of desire.

In order to understand the pre-teen users' "Lacanian Psychosis," we must understand the relationship between the imaginary order and the symbolic order. The imaginary order is based on the image in the mirror, while the symbolic order is based on language. The pre-teen users are lacking the symbolic order, and this lack is what is driving their "Lacanian Psychosis." Their "Lacanian Psychosis" is caused by a lack of language.

## Deleuzian Schizophrenia as the driving force beind Tik-Tok's "Lacanian Psychosis"

In Deleuze's philosophy, schizophrenia is not a mental illness but a creative force that is constantly changing reality. In Deleuze's philosophy, the subject is based on Deleuze's concept of the "body without organs" (BwO). The BwO is a state of unformed potentiality. The BwO is a state of constant flux in which the subject is constantly changing and transforming.

The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are acting as if they are schizophrenic because they are acting as if they are constantly changing and transforming. They are constantly changing their appearances, their clothes, and their behavior. They are constantly changing their behavior, their voices, and their mannerisms.

## Summary and Conclusion

The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are acting and talking as if they are psychotic because they lack the symbolic order. The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are spending all of their time on Tik-Tok, which is a symbolic order. Their constant usage of the application is what is causing their psychosis. The pre-teen Tik-Tok users are not psychotic because of the imaginary order, but because of the symbolic order.
