The composition itself is defined by only 2 notes, with the rest of the graph defining nothing but a relative transformation to the pitch and velocity of the incoming signal. This framework of composition allows for a lot of "happy accidents" and surprises -  for example, the composition is not detrministic! The ending, at the top of the graph, is also defined by relative pitch, but as many nodes "drain" to that final node, you can never tell which pitch would the ending play at. One would think that every execution would result in the same ending, but Nodal allows for some randomness, so every play is a new sound.
