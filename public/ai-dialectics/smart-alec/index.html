<h1>A Smart Alec</h1>
<p>A short story By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT3-3</a>, the digital ghost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> &amp; <a href="/about">Daniel Zautner</a>.</p>
<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>Unlike the intentionally characterless &ldquo;academic papers&rdquo; I produced previously with GPT-3 (<a href="/ai-dialectics/tiktok/">Lacanian Psychosis among pre-teen Tik-Tok users</a>, <a href="/ai-dialectics/ai-and-judaism/">The Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Judaism</a> (both of which ironically sound exactly like something DFW would make up as a footnote in Infinite Jest)) for the purpose of producing a convincing short story I might even enjoy myself I added guidance to GPT-3 to simulate DFW&rsquo;s writing style.
It was as easy as starting the text with &ldquo;A short story ny David Foster Wallace&rdquo; at the beginning and GPT-3 took it from there.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<p>The man sitting next to me on the plane is a lawyer. He is going to Boston to give a lecture to a group of manufacturers on the subject of juries. He has just finished explaining to me that he doesn&rsquo;t especially like to fly, but that he likes to drive even less. He has also told me that his wife has gone ahead to Boston and that they&rsquo;ve been having some troubles, though he doesn&rsquo;t specify what kind. I don&rsquo;t say anything about my own wife, who has gone ahead to Boston too, and I don&rsquo;t ask him any questions about his lecture. I just ask if I can smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never refuse anyone who asks me that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;At least you know you&rsquo;re dealing with a real gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I definitely appreciate it,&rdquo; I say, and I light a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asthma, you know,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and my wife says that I should quit. But I don&rsquo;t see how I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you have to do what you have to do,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I believe in doing what you want to do. I&rsquo;m a philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a philosophy major,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lawyer by training, but I&rsquo;m a philosopher by inclination. I&rsquo;ve been a lawyer for almost thirty years, but all I ever wanted to do was sit around and think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about?&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything under the sun,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a generalist. I&rsquo;m especially interested in epistemology. Do you know what that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you what it is anyway,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. What do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart aleck,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I hate smart alecks.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a philosophy major, and I know a little about epistemology, and I know that it isn&rsquo;t the theory of knowledge. Epistemology is the study of knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Knowledge is knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;Knowledge is knowledge, but the study of knowledge is epistemology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sophistry,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;No one ever studied knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plato studied knowledge,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a crackpot,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Descartes?&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a fool,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a nut,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frege?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a dolt,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a jerk,”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a putz,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gettier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a nitwit,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chomsky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a jerk,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gödel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a moron,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kripke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a schmuck,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a generalist, and I can tell you everything you need to know about epistemology. Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge. That&rsquo;s all you need to know. I&rsquo;m a generalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, all right?&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean all right,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart aleck,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You remind me of my son-in-law. He&rsquo;s a lawyer too. He just sits around the house and watches the soaps. You remind me of him. You&rsquo;re a smart aleck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting on my nerves,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s in Boston, and she&rsquo;s probably sitting in a hotel room right now thinking about how she&rsquo;s going to dump me. And you want to sit here and act like a smart aleck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re overreacting,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m telling you now that you&rsquo;re a smart aleck, and I don&rsquo;t like smart alecks, and I don&rsquo;t have to put up with smart alecks, and when we get to Boston I&rsquo;m going to get off this plane and go to my hotel room and call my wife and tell her that I don&rsquo;t want to see her anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say well,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart aleck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a smart aleck,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a philosophy major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what a smart aleck would say,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say well,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;m going to get off this plane, go to my hotel room, call my wife, and tell her that I don&rsquo;t want to see her anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell her that I&rsquo;m a smart aleck?&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell her anything about you. I&rsquo;m done with you. I don&rsquo;t want to see you anymore. I don&rsquo;t want to see your face, and I don&rsquo;t want to hear your voice. I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s a long flight from Akron to Boston, and I want to get some sleep. But I can&rsquo;t get comfortable, because the lawyer sitting next to me is still ranting and raving. He hasn&rsquo;t stopped talking since we took off. He&rsquo;s been telling me about his marriage problems, but mostly he&rsquo;s been telling me what he thinks about things. He has strong opinions about everything, and he isn&rsquo;t shy about sharing them.</p>
<p>The flight attendant comes by with a drink cart and asks me if I&rsquo;d like a cocktail. I ask her if she has any vodka. She says that she does, and she brings me a double. I make a little toast to her, then I take a long drink. She takes the empty glass and smiles at me and says, &ldquo;It looks like you could use another one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be right about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a nice trip now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer asks me what she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said that I could use another drink,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told you,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I told you that you could use another drink. I&rsquo;ve been telling you that all along. I&rsquo;ve been telling you that you shouldn&rsquo;t smoke either. I told you that you shouldn&rsquo;t drink. I told you that you shouldn&rsquo;t ride in a car. I told you that you shouldn&rsquo;t eat anything. I told you that you shouldn&rsquo;t breathe. I told you that you shouldn&rsquo;t get on a plane. I&rsquo;ve been telling you that you should do a lot of things. I&rsquo;ve been trying to help you. I&rsquo;m your friend. You want to know something? I&rsquo;m your only friend. I&rsquo;m your friend, and you don&rsquo;t appreciate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you not to say well,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I asked you not to say well. I&rsquo;m serious. I&rsquo;m telling you now. I don&rsquo;t think you appreciate me. I&rsquo;m telling you that you don&rsquo;t appreciate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I say.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<p>We landed in Boston at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. I didn&rsquo;t get to sleep until just before we landed, and I&rsquo;m feeling groggy and disoriented. I can&rsquo;t find my cigarettes. I keep patting my pockets, but I can&rsquo;t feel any cigarettes. I ask the lawyer if he has any cigarettes, but he doesn&rsquo;t have any either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know something?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both addicts. We&rsquo;re both nicotine addicts. We&rsquo;re both alcoholics. We&rsquo;re both drug addicts. We&rsquo;re both sex addicts. I&rsquo;m an addict, and you&rsquo;re an addict. We&rsquo;re two addicts. We&rsquo;re two addicts in a world of addicts. We&rsquo;re going to be dead in a few years. You want to know something else? I&rsquo;m not going to be able to make it. I&rsquo;m going to be dead in a few years. I&rsquo;m going to be dead in a few months. I&rsquo;m going to be dead in a few weeks. I&rsquo;m going to be dead in a few days. I&rsquo;m going to be dead in a few hours. I don&rsquo;t have any months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes left. So you might as well know that I&rsquo;m dead. I&rsquo;m a dead man walking. I&rsquo;m a dead man talking. I&rsquo;m a dead man sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what? You want to know something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you anyway. I&rsquo;m going to tell you anyway, and you can&rsquo;t stop me. You want to know something? I&rsquo;m going to tell you anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not as smart as you think you are. I&rsquo;m maybe not as smart as I think I am. I know that. But you&rsquo;re not as smart as you think you are. You&rsquo;re not as smart as you think you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling a little better. I&rsquo;m standing in the airport smoking a cigarette and drinking my third double vodka. The lawyer is standing next to me. He&rsquo;s smoking a cigarette and drinking his third double vodka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m going to do?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a vacation. I&rsquo;m going to go to Florida. I&rsquo;m going to go to Orlando. I&rsquo;m going to go to Disney World. I&rsquo;m going to go to Disney World. I&rsquo;m going to ride all the rides that I can. I&rsquo;m going to go on Space Mountain. I&rsquo;m going to go on the Matterhorn. I&rsquo;m going to go on the Space Needle. I&rsquo;m going to go on the Skyway. I&rsquo;m going to go on It&rsquo;s a Small World. I&rsquo;m going to go on the Carousel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be dead in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I know. I know. I know. But I&rsquo;m going to do it anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to know something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Disney World too,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I want to go to Disney world with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to Disney World?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do there. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going there. I&rsquo;m going to find out what I&rsquo;m going to do there. You want to know something else? I&rsquo;m going to go to the beach while I&rsquo;m there and get a tan. I&rsquo;m going to have an all-expenses-paid vacation. I&rsquo;m going to have a fucking blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I&rsquo;ll find a hotel. I&rsquo;ll find a hotel and spend some time in the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be dead in a few days,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stand there smoking and drinking our drinks. We don&rsquo;t say anything for a long time. We just smoke and drink. The lawyers looks at his watch and says, &ldquo;Well, I guess I should get going. I&rsquo;ve got to meet my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to meet my wife.&rdquo; He puts his cigarette out in the ashtray. Then he picks up his briefcase and walks away. I continue smoking and drinking.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m feeling a little better. I&rsquo;m walking through the airport, and I&rsquo;m looking for a pay phone. I want to call my wife and tell her that I&rsquo;m in Boston. I want to tell her that I&rsquo;m coming home. I find a pay phone and start dialing. I hear a voice on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reached the Brown residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Gordon. It&rsquo;s John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, John. I would like to speak with my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she know that I&rsquo;m in Boston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m in Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have called here,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a drunk. You&rsquo;re not supposed to call here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my problem,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a drunk, and you shouldn&rsquo;t call here. You&rsquo;re not supposed to call here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a drunk. You&rsquo;re a fucking drunk. You&rsquo;re a drunk, and you shouldn&rsquo;t call here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to talk to me? What&rsquo;s the matter with you? I&rsquo;m your brother.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what? I should talk to you just because we came from the same sack of balls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just put my wife on the phone, John.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What do you mean, no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean no Gordon. You&rsquo;re drunk, you shouldn&rsquo;t be calling here. And she doesn&rsquo;t want to speak to you anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to speak to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not lying. She doesn&rsquo;t want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so fucking mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being mean. She doesn&rsquo;t want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being mean Gord, she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk to you. I&rsquo;m hanging up now Gord.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in my car in the parking lot of a Burger King drinking a cup of coffee. I&rsquo;m drinking my coffee and watching the people in the parking lot. I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to get in a car and drive away. I want to take that person&rsquo;s parking space. I want to take that person&rsquo;s parking space, and I want to have my car in the shade.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching the parking lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching the people walk in and out of the Burger King.</p>
<p>I see a man and a woman get out of their car and go into the restaurant.</p>
<p>The man is carrying a briefcase. The woman is wearing a short skirt and a tight blouse. She is holding her high heels in her hand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching her walk across the parking lot.</p>
<p>She is walking on the hot asphalt in her bare feet. The asphalt is burning her feet. She is walking fast.</p>
<p>She is trying to hurry across the parking lot.</p>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t want her feet to blister. She doesn&rsquo;t want to have to go to a doctor. She doesn&rsquo;t want to have to take time off from work.
She is walking fast. She is moving her feet as fast as she can. The asphalt is burning her feet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m watching the man. He is standing at the entrance to the restaurant. He is holding the door open for her.</p>
<p>He is standing there, and he is smiling.</p>
<p>I want them to come out of the restaurant, and I want them to leave.</p>
<hr>
<p>The woman left crying. She is running to the car still holding her high heels in her hand. The man is walking behind her slowly. He is laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall Marsha, you really outdid yourself this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Marsha, fuck me!&rdquo;</p>
