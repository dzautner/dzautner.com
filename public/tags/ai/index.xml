      <description>A short story By GPT3-3, the digital ghost of David Foster Wallace &amp;amp; Daniel Zautner.
Preface Unlike the intentionally characterless &amp;ldquo;academic papers&amp;rdquo; I produced previously with GPT-3 (Lacanian Psychosis among pre-teen Tik-Tok users, The Effects of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Judaism (both of which ironically sound exactly like something DFW would make up as a footnote in Infinite Jest)) for the purpose of producing a convincing short story I might even enjoy myself I added guidance to GPT-3 to simulate DFW&amp;rsquo;s writing style.</description>

The article will discuss the theory of the real, the subject, and the signifier in relation to psychosis. The article will also discuss the relationship of the signifier to the subject at the level of the ego in order to understand the strange behavior of pre-teen users of Tik-Tok.</description>

ABSTRACT The Jewish people are entering a new era of Jewish life with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. This new era brings with it new challenges to the Jewish community, such as the possible need for Jewish law to adapt to the new technology and the new ways in which it is used. With the creation of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;DeepText&amp;rdquo; project, we have witnessed how AI can be trained to understand and interpret the Torah text.</description>
