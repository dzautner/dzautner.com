      <description>By GPT3-3, the ghost of Jorge Luis Borges and Daniel Zautner&#xA;Preface I reched the GPT3&amp;rsquo;s token limit with this story, so it is unfinished in every sense.&#xA;Synopsis A man is dying, and as he dies the time is getting slower and he can&amp;rsquo;t stop remembering his sins. In the end, he realizes he&amp;rsquo;s in hell&#xA;Chapter 1 It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since he began to feel bewildered, and he had not, yet, decided to go to the doctor.</description>
